# osx-image-bootstrap

This repository contains the scripts and instructions for setting up an OS X VM
like the way the Travis CI OS X build environments are provisioned.

Please note that these instructions were written for the environment that Travis
CI runs OS X VMs in (currently vSphere), so you may have to tweak the steps
quite a bit if you're trying to set up a VM elsewhere.
